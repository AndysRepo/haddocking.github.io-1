At the occasion of the [EOSC-Hub week conference](https://www.eosc-hub.eu/events/eosc-hub-week-2020-goes-virtual) that took place online (May 18-20, 2020), Alexandre Bonvin gave during [closing plenary session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYj5DAIU19c&t=917) an interview and live demo of the [HADDOCK](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4) thematic service. The demo shows how [EOSC](https://eosc-hub.eu) enables the [WeNMR](https://www.wenmr.eu) services to support thousands of researcher worldwide in the field of structural biology. WeNMR is linked to the [Instruct-ERIC ESFRI](https://instruct-eric.eu).
