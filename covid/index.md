## COVID-19 related research projects from the CSB group

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has emerged from Wuhan, China in
December 2019 has spread to almost all countries in the World causing a
dramatic number of deaths. The current absence of  antiviral treatment
against the SARS-CoV-2 urges the scientific community to accelerate the
drug discovery research process.

One way to identify potential treatments and to be able to administer it
swiftly is to focus on drug repurposing studies, i.e. to investigate the
SARS-CoV-2 antiviral potential of drugs that have already been approved
for human use.

### Screening of approved drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 protease

Proteins that are crucial for the survival and replication of the virus
are the most attractive targets for such studies. Here we have focused on
the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) that plays an essential role in the
virus replication process by screening ~2000 compounds against this particular
protein. The results of our effort can be seen in the tables and graphs below.
